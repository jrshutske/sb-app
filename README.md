## STEALTHbits Demo Project

This project was created for [STEALTHbits](https://www.stealthbits.com/) to demonstrate a working knowledge of React.<br>

The goal was to create a single page react application that fetched data from a [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/) endpoint and display it to two tables.<br>

These tables were to have multiple features, such as: pagination, adjustable page length, and the ability to click on a row to display more information.<br>
